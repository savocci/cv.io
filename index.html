          </div>
          <p>Hi there!</p>
          <p>I'm Joonas, a seasoned 34-year-old Web Analyst based in Helsinki, holding an M.Sc. in Marketing. With nearly four years of experience in digital advertising, including two years as a full-time Web Analyst, I have collaborated with both Finnish and international B2C and B2B companies.</p>
          <p>My daily toolkit includes Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Google Data Studio, along with proficiency in Google Sheets and Excel. I'm adept at working closely with developers and have successfully implemented multiple data layer solutions.</p>
          <p>What truly fuels my passion is working with data-rich environments, particularly with substantial clients. During my career, I also delved into programming, initially through Google Ads scripts, and have since developed a range of scripts for diverse purposes.</p>
          <p>If you believe my skills align with your needs, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the opportunity of collaborating with you!</p>
